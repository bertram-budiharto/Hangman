There are a couple of assumptions that players need to take note of while playing the game to ensure the proper functioning of the game. 

1. Player needs to enter one letter at a time, as opposed to entering one full word or a phrase of a word. In other words, the player can only enter at max one letter/alphabet each time it prompts the player to do so.

2. It is assumed that the player will not enter the same alphabetical character more than once. Player needs to takenote of what alphabets they have entered and remember not to enter them again.
